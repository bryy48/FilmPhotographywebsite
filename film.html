	<p>Choosing the right film comes mostly down to knowing the sort of light you’re going to be shooting in. Unlike digital cameras where you can change the ISO at any time, when shooting film the ISO is fixed by the film you choose to load into the camera and can’t be changed in any other way than by changing the roll of film or shooting the chosen film at a different “exposure index.” It’s important to load a film that is suitable for the lighting you are going to be shooting in, or at least one that suits your creative goals.</p>

	<p>Low Speed Films classed as a low-speed range from 20 to 200 ISO. These are the films to use when you’ve got lots of available light. You can use these films handheld on very bright days. If you haven’t got as much light it’s best to use a tripod. This will help avoid camera shake when using slow shutter speeds. Low ISO films are particularly good when you want to capture very fine detail.</p>

	<p>High Speed High-speed or fast, films range from 400 to 3200 ISO. These films give you a lot more flexibility on overcast days and in low light situations. Also, they are a good choice if you’re shooting fast-moving subjects.You get more noticeable grain with fast films. The reason for the increased grain is down to the larger silver halide crystals in the emulsion, these basically are the film grain. These crystals pick up more light but are more visible in your image. The higher the ISO the more grain you’ll tend to see.</p>

	<p>Box Speed ISO is the number you set your light meter with. This is also referred to as rating your film. When people talk about rating their film at “box speed” it means they are using the recommended ISO for that film. Literally, the number on the box.</p>
