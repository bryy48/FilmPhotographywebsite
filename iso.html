	<p>What is film speed? It is the sensitivity of the film. Film speed is determined by an ISO number (in the UK/US this used to be known as ASA). You will always find a number on your box of film. This ISO indicates how sensitive the film is to light. It lets your camera or light meter know what other settings are needed to get a good exposure. Speeds can range from 20 all the way up 3200. 
	<p>Low Speed Films classed as a low-speed range from 20 to 200 ISO. These are the films to use when you’ve got lots of available light. You can use these films handheld on very bright days. If you haven’t got as much light it’s best to use a tripod. This will help avoid camera shake when using slow shutter speeds. Low ISO films are particularly good when you want to capture very fine detail.</p>
	<p>High Speed
	High-speed or fast, films range from 400 to 3200 ISO. These films give you a lot more flexibility on overcast days and in low light situations. Also, they are a good choice if you’re shooting fast-moving subjects.You get more noticeable grain with fast films. The reason for the increased grain is down to the larger silver halide crystals in the emulsion, these basically are the film grain. These crystals pick up more light but are more visible in your image. The higher the ISO the more grain you’ll tend to see.</p>
	<p>Box Speed ISO is the number you set your light meter with. This is also referred to as rating your film. When people talk about rating their film at “box speed” it means they are using the recommended ISO for that film. Literally, the number on the box.</p>

		<p>A low ISO number will mean it’s a slow film and is less sensitive to light. The higher the number the faster the film and the more sensitive it is to light. ISO can help you capture images in darker environments, or be more flexible about your aperture and shutter speed settings. However, raising your ISO has consequences. A photo taken at too high of an ISO will show a lot of grain, also known as noise, and might not be usable. Here is an example of a photo taken with high ISO and taken with a low ISO.</p>
